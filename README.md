# Holocene Period Volcanoes and Farmers Markets
This repository is used to aggregate my final applied data science capstone with coursera. The goal is to analyze the relationship of neighboring farmers markets to holocene period volcanoes..

## Introduction
### Why Volcanoes?
I have always been fascinated by volcanoes and their remarkable destructive power. This power is so obscene, unless you've actually witnessed a volcanic eruption its almost impossible to grasp the magnitude of force. When a volcano erupts, they spew all sorts of gases into the atmosphere and magma onto the earth.  Most of the gases are toxic, yet contain chemicals that are a foundation for life. Magma after thousands of years turn into soil, which fills the ground with rich nutrients directly from our mantle. 

I will use a combination of geographic data from the united states volcanic eruptions in the holocene period (past 11,700 years) provided by kaggle.com (an open source data platform) and foursquare.com. Foursquare is an intelligent location tracking software. I will use this platform to gather farmers market data from locations in the United States. From there, I will apply the k-means algorithm to analyze the clusters of farmers markets around the different volcanoes. Upon doing so, I can analyze the distribution of clusters in relation to the volcano. If there is an observable correlated distribution, then it is possible that the mineral deposits from the volcanoes over the holocene period has contributed to the farmers market centralization around those volcanoes. 

## Applications
As our population increases, food production will need to be optimized to meet the growing consumption needs. One thing the pandemic highlighted, is that our current supply chain is not able to meet massive demand (remember the toilet paper and meat shortage?) as it arises. The majority of middle america is used for farming, but what if you could increase the quantity and quality by farming in a more minerally rich soil area?
