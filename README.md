# Holocene Period Volcanoes and Nearby Venues Analysis
## How geologic activity in the Americas has shaped commerce activities.
This repository is used to aggregate my final applied data science capstone with coursera. The goal is to analyze the relationship of neighboring venues near holocene period volcanoes to understand how climate, cultural and commerce similarities/differences differ by region.

## Introduction
### Why Volcanoes?
I have always been fascinated by volcanoes and their remarkable destructive power. This power is so obscene, unless you've actually witnessed a volcanic eruption its almost impossible to grasp the magnitude of force. When a volcano erupts, they spew all sorts of gases into the atmosphere and magma onto the earth.  Most of the gases are toxic, yet contain chemicals that are a foundation for life. Magma after thousands of years turn into soil, which fills the ground with rich nutrients directly from our mantle. I can go on.

## Data/Methodology 
I will use a combination of geographic data from the United States volcanic eruptions in the holocene period (past 11,700 years) provided by kaggle.com (an open source data platform) and foursquare.com. Foursquare is an intelligent location tracking software. I will use this platform to gather venue data from locations in the identified volcanic regions. From there, I will apply the k-means algorithm to analyze the clusters of venues around the different volcanoes. Upon doing so, I can analyze the distribution of clusters in relation to the volcano. If there is an observable difference, then it is possible that the activity from the volcanoes over the holocene period has contributed to the differences in centralization around those volcanoes. 

## Applications
As our earth is forever changing, understanding the relationship between volcanic activity and economic development could help us optimize commerce in a potentially toxic environment.
